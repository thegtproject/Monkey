# Monkey
Toy virtual machine host. Configures and run virtual machines that emulate 80286 type systems and hopefully more in the future. The first vm of focus is a port of XTulator, a 80286 vm programmed in C. Also contains a sub toy project, MXVM, which is my own emulator. This entire project is for me to learn C++ for the first time.
